<h4> <center>This package is under construction. Feel free to contribute. </center></h4>

Laravel Architect was created by, and is maintained by [Vittorio Emmermann](https://github.com/vittoroe), founder of cierra. It's a helper you can install global to your machine or local to your package to make it easier to develop them. So for example if you want to create a test to your laravel package, you can easily do this with `architect make:test MyAwesomeTest`

- Built on top of the [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/).
- Installable global to your machine as general helper.
- Also useable locally in single projects.

## Installation

To install Laravel Architect we recomment to install it globally to gather the best usage of this package:<br />
`composer global require "cierrateam/laravel-architect"`

But at the moment you have to add `"minimum-stability": "dev"` to your global composer config, because laravel zero is only available in dev for laravel 7. Sorry for that, we'll update here asap.

## Documentation

Here is work in progress :) Feel free to contribute.
